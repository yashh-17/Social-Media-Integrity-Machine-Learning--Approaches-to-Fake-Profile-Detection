# Social Media Integrity: Machine Learning Approaches to Fake Profile Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake profiles on social media platforms using machine learning techniques. By leveraging various classification models, we analyze user attributes and identify whether a profile is genuine or fake. The dataset includes 1338 fake users and 1482 genuine users.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation metrics to measure model accuracy
- Automated pipeline for fake profile detection

## 🛠️ Installation
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Git
- Virtual Environment (venv)

### **Setup the Project**
1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashh-17/Social-Media-Integrity-Machine-Learning--Approaches-to-Fake-Profile-Detection.git
cd Social-Media-Integrity-Machine-Learning
```

2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

3️⃣ Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Running the Project
Run the main detection script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📊 Model Training
To train a model, run:
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

## ❗ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- Ensure your dataset is correctly placed in the `data/` directory.
- Verify that all dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
- Activate the virtual environment before running scripts.
